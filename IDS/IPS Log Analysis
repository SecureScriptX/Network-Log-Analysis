# IDS/IPS Log Analysis

The IDS/IPS concept and solutions are technologies developed where rule-based access controls of firewall devices are insufficient in the security world. While the firewall works on a rule basis, IDS/IPS solutions check for anomalies in the packet content, preventing suspicious/malicious packets/requests from reaching the target and protecting systems from potential attacks.

## IDS vs IPS
- **IPS:** Intrusion Prevention System - Detects and prevents suspicious activities.
- **IDS:** Intrusion Detection System - Only detects suspicious activities.

IDS and IPS have a signature database, a set of rules designed to detect known attacks. Many firewall manufacturers provide the IDS/IPS module as an additional license. Snort or Suricata are well-known open-source IDS/IPS solutions.

IDS/IPS systems are crucial for detecting and preventing network-based or host-based attacks, generating frequent alarms. SOC analysts access IDS/IPS outputs via SIEM or SOAR, where alerts are presented based on rules, correlations, level, category, and occurrence.
