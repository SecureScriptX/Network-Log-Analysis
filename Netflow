# Netflow for Generic Log Analysis

Netflow, a network protocol developed by Cisco, is designed to collect IP traffic information and is supported by various manufacturers. Some manufacturers may support Sflow or similar protocols. The key feature of Netflow is its ability to provide network visibility, irrespective of the brand or developer of the protocol.

## Importance of Netflow Visibility

With Netflow visibility, various benefits arise:

- **Billing for Services:** Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can accurately bill for the services provided.

- **Network Design and Analysis:** Netflow is instrumental in network design and analysis.

- **Network Monitoring:** It facilitates monitoring by identifying sources generating the most traffic, frequently used ports, etc.

- **Service Quality Measurement:** Netflow helps in measuring service quality within the network.

- **Anomaly Detection for SOC Analysts:** SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts leverage Netflow information to detect anomalies.

## Netflow Operation

Netflow operates in a stateful structure, monitoring and reporting all IP traffic passing over the monitored interface. Each IP communication is defined as a "flow," representing the set of packets between the source and destination. Key information collected for flow formation includes:

- Source IP Address
- Destination IP Address
- Source Port (UDP and TCP protocols only)
- Destination Port (UDP and TCP protocols only)
- IP Protocol
- Interface Information
- IP Version Information

*Note: NetFlow data is typically not produced in a legible text format by devices. In order to true generated by applications that convert the raw data into a readable format.


Via the NetFlow outputs, we can detect:

- Abnormal traffic volume increases

- Data leaks

- Access to private systems

- New IPs in the network

- Systems accessed for the first time as well as analyze related issues
